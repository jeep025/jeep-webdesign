	<p class="first">When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs When they pl<span class="chinese"></span>ayed I'd sing along, it made me smile</p><br><br>

	<p class="second">Those were such happy times and not so long ago. How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend. All the songs I loved so well</p><br><br>

	<p class="first">Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's, so fine</p><br><br>

	<p class="second">When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry, just like before
It's yesterday once more</p><br><br>

	<p class="first">Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad, so much has changed.</p><br><br>

	<p class="second">It was songs of love that I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away</p><br><br>

	<p class="first">Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine</p><br><br>

<p class="second">All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry, just like before
It's yesterday once more</p><br><br>

<p class="first">Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine</p><br><br>

<p class="second">Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling</p><br><br>
